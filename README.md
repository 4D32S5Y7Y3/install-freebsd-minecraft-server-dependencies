# mcsd-freebsd

These are shell scripts for installing all the dependencies of Minecraft Server in FreeBSD using pkg. 

If you're building Minecraft Server in FreeBSD from the ports, it is better that you install all of its dependencies using pkg, as that will greatly speed up the building process.

I made this by copying the dependencies from here:
https://ports.freebsd.org/cgi/ports.cgi?query=minecraft-server&stype=all

`mcsd` stands for `minecraft server dependencies`
